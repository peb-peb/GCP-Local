# `OpenPDFManager` üìÑ

> A free and open-source cross-platform PDF Management Software.

The goal of this project is to provide an all-in-one PDF toolkit that allows users to extract, rotate, and delete pages instantly, as well as combine PDFs, all in just a few clicks. 

Additionally, we aim to create a nice graphical user interface to make the tool accessible to a larger audience.
