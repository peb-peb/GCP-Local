# `OpenPDFManager` üìÑ

> A free and open-source cross-platform PDF Management Software.

The goal of this project is to provide an all-in-one PDF toolkit that allows users to extract, rotate, and delete pages instantly, as well as combine PDFs, all in just a few clicks. 

Additionally, we aim to create a nice graphical user interface to make the tool accessible to a larger audience.

The **`OpenPDFManager`** is developed in Python using `flet` (a relatively new GUI library for python). This would serve as a personal project and a guide for any new flet learners. 

### Installation

**Prerequisites:**

- `python` must be installed on your system. To install it, refer [this](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- `git` should also be present. Refer [this](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- That's all you need!!! üòâ

Now, go into your terminal and run the following commands step-by-step:

## FAQ

**_FOSSHack Questionnaire:_**

Q. What was the idea for the project?

> I frequently required to perform many operations on PDF due to my College Assignments.

Q. What stage is it in now?

> The Application was built in 2 days in FOSS Hack 3.0. So, it currently supports only the `merge` feature, but, soon I'll be adding other features to it.
